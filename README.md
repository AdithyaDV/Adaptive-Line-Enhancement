## Abstract

One of the most important and complex techniques on elements of signal processing has been the noise suppression. Noise is a very basic, of whose frequency response cannot be known all the time. Considering the motivation of trying to suppress the noise component, a focus on filters and ADAPTIVENESS has been put to extract a narrow band signal masked with wide band noise. This work includes a comparative analysis on different FIR adaptive filter algorithms, with addition to an implementation on test audio signal. The results quite provided the difference in between LMS, RLS, NLMS and APAs.

## Additional Notes

The implementation of this system is a part of course project (Digital Signal Processing)
